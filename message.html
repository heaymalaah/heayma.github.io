            <strong>My dearest baby boy,</strong><br><br>

            I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about everything‚Äîabout us, our time together, and how much you mean to me. I know I‚Äôve made mistakes and hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry. I can‚Äôt take back the pain I caused, but what I can do is show you that I‚Äôm committed to growing, learning, and being better for us. I know there have been moments where I haven‚Äôt been the best version of myself, but I want you to know how much I value you. You are my safe place, my constant, and I‚Äôm grateful for every moment we‚Äôve shared. It‚Äôs been hard lately, but I want you to know I‚Äôll keep trying, for both of us. I love you with all my heart, and I‚Äôm here to make things better.
        </p>

        <p class="message-text">
            I know that space has been a big part of our relationship lately, and I want you to know that I understand why. I‚Äôve learned to respect your need for space and time for yourself. If ever you need distance or time to think, I will give it to you without hesitation. And if you‚Äôre not ready to meet or if you want to go out with friends, I‚Äôll respect that too. What matters most to me is that you feel comfortable, and that you know I‚Äôll always be here when you‚Äôre ready. Space doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre drifting apart; it just means we‚Äôre taking the time we need to grow individually so that we can come together even stronger.
        </p>

        <p class="message-text">
            I‚Äôm not asking for perfection. I don‚Äôt expect us to be completely ‚Äúfixed‚Äù right away, but what I do expect is that we continue trying. I want to build a relationship with you where we can face challenges together, where we communicate honestly, where we support each other even in the toughest times, and where love always remains at the center of it all. You‚Äôve shown me so much love in your own way, and now it‚Äôs my turn to show you mine. I want to thank you, Mads, for everything. For your patience, your understanding, your love. Even when I‚Äôve felt lost or unsure, you‚Äôve been there to reassure me. Even when things were tough, you didn‚Äôt give up on me. And for that, I am forever grateful. I promise to keep trying. To keep growing. To keep learning. Because you deserve the best version of me, and I‚Äôll work every day to be that for you.
        </p>

        <p class="message-text">
            No matter what, I want you to know that I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm not going anywhere. And as we move forward, I hope we can keep reminding each other that love, no matter how difficult the journey, is worth the effort. I just want to be with you, to support you, and to love you in every way I can. Let‚Äôs take things one step at a time. I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I love you, and that‚Äôs what matters the most.
        </p>

        <p class="message-signature">
            Yours always, <br>
